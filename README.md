# Polynomial-Inheritance-CSA
This is another project assigned to me for APCSA. For this project, I had to create several classes related to polynomials and organize them into a hierarchy. Has some useful methods like finding the 1st/2nd zero's of quadratic functions, determining if a quadratic's solutions are real, and if the quadratic is a perfect trinomial square. Might refine some aspects if I feel like it.

Files: 
PolynomialInheritenceRunner - contains main method;
Polynomial - parent class of trinomial/quadratic, creates polynomial objects, contains basic polynomial info like # of terms/degree;
Trinomial - parent class of quadratic, creates trinomial objects, contains more specific info like coefficient values;
Quadratic - creates quadratic objects, contains even more specific info like the value of the discriminant, also contains the useful methods mentioned above;
Criteria - just the criteria I had for the project, redundant
