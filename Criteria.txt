Polynomial class: 
• 2 instance variables – degree and number of terms (X)
• 1 parameter constructor – if the degree is less than 0, it is assigned a value of 0 (X)
• 2 accessor methods for degree and number of terms (X)
• toString() method that prints the number of terms and degree (X)
• equals() method that checks if two Polynomials have the same degree and number of terms (X)
 
Trinomial class: 
• 3 instance variables – lead coefficient, middle coefficient, and last coefficient (when the trinomial is 
placed in standard form) (X)
• 1 parameter constructor – 4 arguments passed, the degree and three coefficients. This constructor should 
call on the super's constructor (X)
• 3 accessor methods for the three instance variables (X)
• toString() method that calls on the super's toString() method and also prints off the coefficient 
values (X)
• equals() method that calls on the super's equals() method to check if the terms and degree are 
equivalent as well as check the three coefficients to see if those are equivalent. (X)
 
Quadratic class: 
• 1 instance variable – the discriminant 𝑏2 −4𝑎𝑐 where 𝑎𝑥2 +𝑏𝑥+𝑐 (X)
• 1 parameter constructor – 3 arguments passed, standing for a, b, and c. This should call on the super's 
constructor appropriately as well as calculate the discriminant and assign it correctly. (X)
• 1 accessor method for the discriminant (X)
• toString() method that calls on the super's toString() as well as prints off the quadratic 
formatted as ax^2 + bx + c (X)
• equals() method that calls on the super's equal() method (X)
• hasRealSolutions() method uses the discriminant to check if the quadratic has real solutions 
(discriminant >= 0). Returns true if it does and false if it does not. (X)
• firstZero() method returns the first zero from the quadratic formula (adding). You can assume this 
method will only be called if there are real solutions. 
• secondZero() method returns the second zero from the quadratic formula (subtracting). You can 
assume this method will only be called if there are real solutions. 
• isPerfectSquare() method returns true if the quadratic is a perfect square trinomial 𝑎2 +2𝑎𝑏+
𝑏2 and false if it is not.
